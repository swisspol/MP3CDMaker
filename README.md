Overview
========

**Convert iTunes playlists into MP3 CDs in one click â€” it works even with playlists containing songs not in MP3 format!**

Select a music playlist from your iTunes library, then its songs will be automatically converted to MP3 format in the desired quality and burned to a CD. It works with most audio files in your iTunes library and does not require manipulating your iTunes library or playlists in any way.

**FEATURES:**
* Supports audio files in MP3, AAC, AIFF or WAV format.
* Choose MP3 audio quality conversion from 64 Kbps to 256 Kbps or use variable bit rate encoding.
* Converts multiple songs to MP3 format in parallel on Macs with multiple processor cores.
* Creates hybrid ISO9660 / Joliet / HFS+ MP3 CDs compatible with all computer and car CD players.
* Can burn multiple MP3 CDs for playlists too large to fit on a single one.
* Burn all songs from a playlist or only selected ones.
* Fully preserves the song order from the iTunes playlist.

**IMPORTANT:**
* A Mac with an optical drive capable of burning CDs (e.g. Apple SuperDrive) is required. 
* DRM protected audio files (e.g. songs purchased on the iTunes Store before iTunes Plus was announced) cannot be converted to MP3 format.
